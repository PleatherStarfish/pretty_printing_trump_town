You must be willing to do more than what your competitors doing. Figure out what they're not doing well, and do it expertly. Regardless of what you're selling, the common denominator is you need to deliver value. Listen to your client/customer, it's not about you. To be an effective and successful manager you must first surround yourself with component/effective people, realizing that you are only as good as the people under you.

As the staff director of the Committee, he coordinated a legislative and oversight plan for Chairman Inhofe that resulted in: the first long-term reauthorization of the nation’s surface transportation infrastructure in 10 years, the enactment of the Frank R Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act for the 21st Century (the first major federal environmental statute rewrite in 20 years), and a new Water Resources Development Act that prioritized funding for national ports and water infrastructure. In all, his leadership contributed to the enactment of over 60 statutes. While working in Congress, Mr. Jackson also worked closely with EPA on new state permitting for coal ash disposal and regulation, and on the reauthorization of the Brownfields program to promote beneficial use and new economic development for these areas. Previously, Mr. Jackson was an assistant district attorney in Oklahoma's 14th Judicial District, which covers Tulsa and Pawnee counties.

In the late 1990's, Mr. Manning served as head of two non-profit organizations; the non-profit Congressional Award Foundation, a public-private partnership designed to work with business, community and congressional leaders to foster personal development and community service in America's youth.

He eventually hired me to work for him at the House Committee on Small Business. As I’m sure some of your staff can attest, the newest staffer often gets the issue no one else wants, and so I started working on Federal procurement policy. Working on contracting, I realized I could make a difference by saving money for taxpayers, improving competition, and helping agencies deliver on their unique missions. More than twenty years later, I still find it compelling. I attended law school at the University of Virginia, earning my J.D., and returned to Washington to practice government contracts law. In 2004, I was honored to join the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as a senior advisor for government contracts and business development and the Acting Administrator for Government Contracting. In that role, I directed a team of over 140 staff nationwide to help the agency better provide assistance to small businesses seeking Federal procurement opportunities. Our team was able to successfully reduce the cycle time for some small business certifications by 65 percent. I am proud to say that during my tenure, the SBA - for the first time in history - met its statutorily-mandated goal of awarding 23 percent of prime contracts to small businesses. In 2005, I had the privilege of joining GSA and serving as its inaugural Chief Acquisition Officer. In this role, I participated in leading the transformation of the agency’s assisted acquisition centers, as well as the consolidation of the Federal Supply Service and the Federal Technology Service. As the agency’s representative to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council and the leader of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, I coordinated efforts to modernize the FAR and GSA regulations to more closely reflect the Federal Government’s increasing use of service contracts, as opposed to commodity buys. Most importantly, I worked closely with the Inspector General (IG) to address contracting issues in GSA’s eleven regions, where the IG had identified problems with improper sole source contracts, misuse of small business contracts, out-of-scope orders being placed against contracts, and Anti-Deficiency Act violations. The auditors attributed their findings to an ineffective system of internal management controls and contract personnel prioritizing customer preference over proper procurement procedures. To address these issues, I worked with the GSA Commissioners and the Regional Administrators to: 1) communicate that failure to follow the law would not be tolerated; 2) identify areas where contracting specialists perceived ambiguity and provide clarity regarding expectations and policy; 3) engage in workforce training targeting identified failures or weaknesses; 4) implement an ongoing series of procurement management reviews to identify other outstanding issues; 5) realign reporting chains and performance plans to ensure that contract specialists were evaluated on the quality of their work; 6) communicate with contractors regarding the proper procedures to follow should a task order appear to exceed to scope of the contract; 7) develop the Schedules eLibrary to assist contracting officers in making scope determinations; 8) institute regular meetings with the Department of Defense (DoD) to insure that any DoD specific requirements or funding issues were appropriately addressed by GSA; and 9) engage in ongoing dialogue with the IG so that all issues could be addressed promptly, thus mitigating risk to the taxpayer. GSA continues to have regular program management reviews, engage in targeted training, and maintain many of these processes. After my time at GSA, I rejoined the private sector and gained critical experience and insight on the Federal contracting process from different perspectives – as a customer, prime contractor and subcontractor; from the civilian and defense sides; and as a lawyer representing clients seeking to navigate the Federal procurement system. These firsthand experiences have been invaluable, as they provided a holistic view of the Federal contracting process. I know the frustrations of customers seeking to contract with the Federal Government because I have been in their shoes, and if confirmed, I will continue to use that experience to improve the process. In 2011, I returned to the House Committee on Small Business, serving again under a Missouri Chairman, Congressman Sam Graves, and then Chairman Steve Chabot of Ohio. While I specialized in acquisition policy, I also worked on capital access, regulatory reform, tax, and trade issues. The Committee conducted rigorous oversight of contracting agencies, including GSA, and worked on bipartisan legislation that aimed to help small businesses seeking to compete for contracts with the Federal Government. These bipartisan reforms - many of which originated in a Republican House, but were adopted by a Democratic Senate and signed into law by then-President Obama - sought to improve opportunities for service-disabled veterans and small technology firms; minimize barriers to entry; reduce regulatory burdens on prime and subcontractors; reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in government contracting; and streamline design-build contracting. I gained further valuable experience during my time on the House Committee on Armed Services (HASC), working on acquisition issues specific to the DoD, such as challenges with commercial item contracts, auditing, service contracting, program management, acquisition workforce, and business processes at the DoD. Earlier this year, I rejoined GSA, where I analyze topics related to acquisition to provide advice to the Acting Administrator, Tim Horne. For instance, I worked with Acting Administrator Horne on the merger of the Federal Acquisition Service and the Technology Transformation Service, the implementation of the Transactional Data rule, and opportunities to improve how GSA facilitates purchases of technology.","General Services Administration","https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/congressional-testimony/nomination-of-emily-w-murphy-to-be-administrator-us-general-services-administration","","Murphy","","","","",""

As Governor of the Lone Star State, Perry championed conservative principles that helped Texas become America’s economic engine. Under Perry’s leadership, Texas became a national leader for job creation, innovation, and population growth. Perry’s leadership of Texas proved that economic growth and protection of the environment can be achieved simultaneously. While adding population and more than 2.2 million jobs during his tenure, Texas also experienced major reductions in carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions. Despite having a rapidly growing population and one of the largest petrochemical refining industries in the world, Texas saw its air quality improve. Perry grew up the son of tenant farmers in the tiny West Texas community of Paint Creek. The younger of Ray and Amelia Perry’s two children, he was active in scouting and earned distinction as an Eagle Scout. He was one of the first in his family to go to college, earning a degree in Animal Science from Texas A&M University, where he was also a member of the Corps of Cadets and a Yell Leader. Between 1972 and 1977, Perry served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East. He is a lifetime member of both the NRA and American Legion Post #75. Prior to being elected Lieutenant Governor in 1998, he served two terms as Texas Commissioner of Agriculture and three terms in the Texas House of Representatives. Perry married his childhood sweetheart, Anita, in 1982. They have two children and two beautiful granddaughters.","Department of Education","https://energy.gov/contributors/rick-perry","","Perry","","","","",""

The HHS Center was formed in 2001, under the George W. Bush administration, to ensure that faith partners and non-profits faced no barriers and were engaged as full partners in serving the poor and helping the vulnerable. This mission continues today. Shannon’s professional background includes both government and private sector experience. In government, she worked for over seven years on Capitol Hill, including serving as Counsel to Senator Chuck Grassley (now Chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee). In the private sector, Shannon worked in several faith-based non-profits. Early on, she led the D.C. office of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), a group focused on issues such as sex trafficking, global hunger, and protecting religious liberty. Most recently, Shannon served as Chief of Staff and C.O.O. at the Family Research Council (FRC), managing day to day operations for a team of 80 in fulfilling the FRC mission of promoting “a culture in which all human life is valued, families flourish, and religious liberty thrives.” Shannon brings personal experiences that have shaped her perspective to the job as well. As a cancer survivor, Shannon knows what it is like to be a patient coping with an often confusing healthcare system. In addition, Shannon’s family has been challenged and strengthened through their experiences as a family with special needs. As a result of her experiences, Shannon has been an advocate in her community to ensure that families with special needs have the supports they need to thrive. In leading the Center, Shannon sees her role as one of service and stewardship, carrying out the vision of the Administration. She received her Juris Doctor from the George Washington University School of Law.

Previously, Schaefer served in the Trump Administration as Senior Counselor to the Secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In that high-level capacity, Schaefer advanced Presidential and Secretary policy priorities at the agency, including managing the development of the HHS response to the opioid abuse crisis. Schaefer is a studied expert on health care reform on both the federal and state levels. She has researched and advised on health reform, Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and prescription drugs. She is well known in Washington policy circles as a champion of patient choice and robust competition in America’s health insurance markets. Schaefer, who has served as Heritage’s director of health policy studies and joined the organization originally in 2001, also was named Preston A. Wells Jr. Fellow in Health Policy in April 2012. As deputy director in 2009, she coordinated the think tank’s related research and was the lead advocate of its stances as debate in Congress over health care reform heated up. She has made the case for consumer-based health policy solutions as a guest expert on dozens of radio and television programs. Her research and analysis have been published in newspapers and periodicals around the country, as well as in such noted policy journals as Health Affairs. She has made presentations at national, state and professional conferences. Schaefer understands the inner workings of Congress, having worked for nearly a decade as a Capitol Hill staffer. She served as legislative director to former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) when he was a representative and to Rep. Sue Myrick (R-N.C.). She began her Hill career on the staff of the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC). The Preston Wells Jr. fellowship, made possible by the Florida-based Lillian S. Wells Foundation, recognized Schaefer's leadership in opposition to what Americans now call “Obamacare” and in efforts to move America to patient-centered, market-based health care. Wells, an entrepreneur, served on Heritage’s Board of Trustees from 1994 until his death in 2003. In 2008, Schaefer won Heritage’s prestigious W. Glenn and Rita Ricardo Campbell Award in recognition of specialized but high-profile work on the uninsured and related issues, in particular the SCHIP. Each year, the award goes to a policy expert who has made “an outstanding contribution to the analysis and promotion of a Free Society.” Schaefer received a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1994.

The mission of that program is to help migrant students and youths meet high academic standards by overcoming obstacles due to frequent moves, educational disruption, cultural and linguistic differences, and health-related problems. During that time, Viana also served as the vice-chair of the Governing Board for the North Carolina Farmworker Health Program. Viana began his career in Miami-Dade County Public Schools as an elementary school teacher for English language learners and later was a humanities instructor at an International Baccalaureate World School. The International Baccalaureate Organization aims to develop knowledgeable young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. Concurrently, Viana prepared and delivered general teaching skills sessions to Florida International University's undergraduate students receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in education in all levels and content areas. After acquiring his degree in educational leadership in 2006, Viana became an elementary school administrator for Durham (North Carolina) Public Schools, where he established the districtwide Title I Parent Advisement Committee for Hispanics to help ensure that Latino children from low-income families met challenging state academic standards. Viana is a second-generation Cuban immigrant who started his primary years as an English language learner. The magnificent teachers he encountered in his early learning inspired him to become an educator. Viana has devoted his life to improving educational opportunities for minority populations and is honored to serve our nation's English learners and their families. Viana and his wife, Aimee, the senior executive director for marriage and family life in the Diocese of Raleigh, North Carolina, have two children. They are expecting their third child this fall. Viana also manages to find time in the evenings to prepare high school students from China for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).","Department of Education","https://www2.ed.gov/news/staff/bios/viana.html","","Viana","","","","Jose Viana served as an administrator of the Migrant Education Program for North Carolina's Department of Public Instruction.",""

Wilson","Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the Secretary","","","","2017-05-10","","https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3766846-Wilson-Heather-A.html","","","","5","heather-a-wilson","true","","","","defense","","","","","An Air Force Academy graduate, Rhodes Scholar, and former National Security Council staff member, Heather Wilson was the first woman veteran of the U.S. armed services to serve in the U.S. Congress and only the second woman to represent New Mexico in Congress.1 Heather A. Wilson was born on December 30, 1960, in Keene, New Hampshire. During her junior year in Keene High School, the U.S. Air Force Academy began admitting women. Wilson, who hoped to become a pilot, like her father and grandfather, entered the academy and graduated in 1982. She earned a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University where, by 1985, she earned a master’s and a doctorate in international relations. Wilson served in the Air Force until 1989 when she joined the National Security Council staff as director for European Defense Policy and Arms Control. In 1991, she married lawyer Jay Hone, and the couple settled in New Mexico. They raised three children: Scott, Joshua, and Caitlin. Wilson then started a consulting firm and, from 1995 to 1998, served in the governor’s cabinet as secretary of the New Mexico children, youth and families department. When New Mexico’s Albuquerque Congressman Steven H. Schiff declared he would not run for re–election in the fall of 1998 because of his battle with skin cancer, Wilson resigned her cabinet post and entered the Republican primary. She won the support of Schiff and U.S. Senator Pete V. Domenici, who lent her several trusted aides and called her “the most brilliantly qualified House candidate anywhere in the country.”2 But Schiff’s death in March necessitated a June 23 special election. With Domenici’s support, Wilson became the Republican candidate for the special election, propelling her to a sizable win in the June 2 primary for the fall election against conservative state senator William F. Davis. Three weeks later, Wilson won the special election (with 45 percent of the vote) in a three–way race against millionaire Democratic state senator Phillip J. Maloof and Green Party candidate Robert L. Anderson. She was sworn into office on June 25, 1998, making her the first woman since Georgia Lusk in 1946, and the first Republican woman ever, to represent New Mexico.3 The special election was but a preview for the fall election for the full two–year term. In both races, Wilson’s slogan “fighting for our families” encompassed an agenda including better public schools, elimination of the marriage penalty, and an elimination of estate taxes. Both races were contentious and costly. For the June 23 special election Maloof spent $3.1 million and portrayed Wilson as an outsider. Leading up to the November 1998 general election, Maloof spent an additional $5 million to Wilson’s $1.1 million, making it the most expensive House race in New Mexico’s history. Wilson prevailed, with 48 percent of the vote. She won her 2000 re–election bid by a seven–point margin over her Democratic challenger. In 2002, she defeated Democrat Richard Romero with 55 percent to 45 percent of the vote. Two years later, she defeated Romero by a similar margin to earn a seat in the 109th Congress (2005–2007). In 2006, when Republicans lost the majority in the House, Wilson faced her stiffest electoral challenge, defeating Democratic candidate Patricia Madrid by 861 votes out of more than 211,000 cast.4 When Wilson took her seat in the House in 1998, she received assignments on the Commerce Committee (later renamed Energy and Commerce), including its subcommittees on Telecommunication, Energy and Air Quality, and Environment and Hazardous Materials. She remained on that panel for the duration of her House career. Wilson also won an additional seat on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. But she left that assignment in the 107th Congress (2001–2003) for a seat on the powerful Armed Services Committee. Armed Services offered her a prime vantage point from which to oversee personnel and infrastructure issues at two installations in her district: Kirtland Air Force Base and the Sandia National Lab. In the 109th Congress, Wilson left Armed Services to return to the Intelligence Committee, where she chaired the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence. Wilson’s reputation in Congress was that of a moderate Republican who was not reluctant to take positions independent of her party. She called for a simplification of the tax codes and became one of the GOP’s point persons in the House to criticize the American bombing campaign in Kosovo. But on social issues, she was more moderate than many of her GOP colleagues. She supported requiring federal workers’ health plans to cover contraceptive coverage (although she opposed using public money to pay for abortions) and also voted down an amendment that would have banned adoptions by gay parents in the District of Columbia. She also opposed a plan by the Republican leadership to move management of the nuclear weapons program (largely based in New Mexico) from the Department of Energy to the Pentagon.5 In 2006, Wilson led efforts to ensure congressional oversight of the President’s terrorist surveillance program. Wilson chose not to seek re–election to a sixth term in the House, and instead announced her intention to run in 2008 for an open U.S. Senate seat being vacated by longtime New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici. Wilson narrowly lost the Republican primary and retired from the House at the conclusion of the 110th Congress on January 3, 2009.","U.S. House of Representatives","http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/24163","","Wilson","","","","",""

Moreover, the APR produced under his leadership received the highest score ever awarded by the Mercatus Center up to that point in time, a 10-year period. In 2009, Webster joined the Department of Defense Business Transformation Agency as its deputy director. In this role he successfully led all internal operations of the agency. Of particular note, he led development of the agency's first strategic plan that directly linked agency-level strategic goals to individual performance plan measures.

Finding ways to assist his and other tribes struggling to meet the challenge of both affordable and accessible healthcare services became Robert’s calling. Robert founded RWI Benefits, LLC in 2007 and is the sole owner of the company. Drawing on his ten years experience in the health care and insurance industries, Robert took up the challenge of reviewing every contract and service agreement in place for Tribal Enterprises in addition to auditing their ongoing premium costs. The result of this review was the implementation of revised and renegotiated benefit plans with a savings in excess of four million dollars for 2007 alone. Robert is known and respected throughout Indian Country as a staunch advocate for Native American health and wellness. His motivation comes from his own family’s devastating experiences with the death and destruction caused by substance abuse, mental health issues, addiction and preventable illnesses. He has chosen to honor the memories of his friends and relatives by working at the tribal, state and federal levels to improve access and affordability to quality healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives through improving employee benefit plans and creating tribal member health, dental, vision and memorial benefit plans.

Running in a Democrat stronghold, Aaron successfully forced a well entrenched 6 term incumbent to defend a seat that had gone uncontested during the previous 3 election cycles. Proving that an aggressive urban Republican candidate can shift support in a highly Democrat district, Aaron received more votes than any previous Republican candidate to run in the 48th District and was the only Republican challenger endorsed by the Washington Post over a Democrat incumbent. Aaron attended the University of Kansas (KU) were he completed a double-major in Political Science and International Affairs, graduating in 2004. In 2001, while attending KU, Aaron put his belief in patriotism to work by joining the United States Marine Corps. As a Marine, he trained as a field radio operator with the 24th Marine Regiment. After graduating college, Aaron served six years with the United States Marine Corp Reserves to include an active-duty tour in Iraq where he served in the Al-Anabar province as an Arabic linguist with the 2ND Marine Division. Following his tour in Iraq, Aaron returned to Virginia where he began his work on Capitol Hill, specializing in the issues of energy, environment, defense, veteran’s affairs and education. Forging bipartisan coalitions in a politically divided congress, Aaron effectively worked with both Democrats and Republicans to advance numerous pieces of legislation. In 2005, while also working full-time, Aaron enrolled in a graduate degree program at American University in Washington, D.C. He used the coalition-building and bipartisan cooperation experience he had gained on Capitol Hill to bring a unique perspective to his studies. In 2008, Aaron graduated from American University with Master’s Degree in U.S. Foreign Policy. He currently resides in Arlington, Virginia where he works as a Congressional Analyst for Dynetics Inc and is an active member of the Arlington Ridge Civic Association, VFW Post 3150, and the Committee for a Better Arlington.","The Leadership Institute","https://www.leadershipinstitute.org/training/contact.cfm?FacultyID=477755","","Ringel","","","","",""

As an active member of Kappa Delta Sorority, I’ve had the opportunity to take on numerous leadership roles within my chapter and on campus. They are listed in detail on my resume but the common theme is public relations and risk management positions. This combination of interests landed me an internship with Attorney General Scott Pruitt’s office working on his 2014 campaign. Getting into politics has been one of the most interesting and fast-paced things I have ever done and I would love to further pursue that field. When it comes to skills, I’ve got a few. Adobe Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator as well as iMovie, Soundslides and GarageBand are all things I can handle.

Governor Perdue immediately went to work reforming the state budget, setting priorities, and cutting wasteful spending. His efforts helped stimulate the economy and turn the state budget deficit that he inherited in to a substantial surplus. The Governor then invested in his top priorities and got results. During Perdue’s first term, Georgia created over 200,000 new jobs and posted the highest graduation rate and SAT scores in state history. After a first term marked by numerous accomplishments, Governor Perdue won re-election by an overwhelming margin in November 2006. As Georgia’s Governor, Perdue has led the state based on his life experiences prior to entering public service. Sonny was born on December 20, 1946, in Perry, Georgia, to a lifelong farmer and a classroom teacher. He graduated from Warner Robins High School and earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1971 from the University of Georgia. Following his service as a Captain in the United States Air Force, Perdue became a successful small business owner, concentrating in agribusiness and transportation. Today, those businesses have grown to include several locations across the Southeast. Perdue was a respected leader in his church and his community when he decided to enter public service. After serving on the Houston County Planning and Zoning Board during the 1980’s, he ran for the Georgia State Senate in 1990 and won. Sonny spent the next 11 years representing his Middle Georgia district in the General Assembly. Perdue left the State Senate in 2001 to begin his successful campaign for Governor, which focused on restoring public trust in state government and empowering all Georgians. As a state senator, he was often praised for tackling issues when no one else had the courage to do so and for his ability to grasp the nuances of complex problems. Sonny was recognized as a leading authority on numerous issues including agriculture, transportation, education, emerging technologies and economic development. Perdue campaigned for Governor on a platform of restoring public trust in state government and empowering all Georgians by eliminating undue interference by government bureaucracies. He has dedicated his administration to attracting new businesses and jobs to Georgia, improving the quality of programs that touch the lives of children, and fighting for a comprehensive ethics reform package. For all of his success in business and public service, Governor Perdue is proudest to serve as devoted husband, loving father, and grandfather. Sonny is married to the former Mary Ruff of Atlanta, Georgia. The couple has four children and eleven grandchildren. Additionally, Sonny and Mary have served as foster parents for eight newborns awaiting adoption. The Perdue’s attend the First Baptist Church of Woodstock, where they have taught a Sunday school class for young couples emphasizing the importance of faith in building a strong and lasting marriage.","Georgia Office of the Governor via Internet Archive","https://web.archive.org/web/20180117193029/http://sonnyperdue.georgia.gov/00/channel_modifieddate/0%252C2096%252C78006749_98067483%252C00.html","","Perdue","","","","",""
